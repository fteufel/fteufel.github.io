## [SignalP 6.0 predicts all five types of signal peptides using protein language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01156-3)

Published in Nature Biotechnology, 2022

We used protein language models to build SignalP 6.0, the first signal peptide predictor capable of predicting all known types of signal peptides in protein sequences.
