I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Copenhagen and Novo Nordisk, working with [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/). Additionally, I  spend some of my time with the [Newman Lab at Stanford](https://anlab.stanford.edu/), researching stem cell transcriptomics. My main research interests are deep learning methods for protein sequence analysis, sequence design and property prediction, as well as transfer learning for biological applications in general. Previously, I studied Biotechnology at ETH Zürich, with my thesis research on signal peptide prediction conducted at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Henrik Nielsen](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/english/Research/Research-Sections/Section-Bioinformatics/Group-Protein-Sorting).
