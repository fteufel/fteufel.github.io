I'm a machine learning researcher with a background in Biotechnology, recently graduated from ETH Zürich. I'm currently working in the [Newman Lab at Stanford](https://anlab.stanford.edu/) on stem cell transcriptomics. Before that, I wrote my MSc thesis on signal peptide prediction in proteins at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Henrik Nielsen](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/english/Research/Research-Sections/Section-Bioinformatics/Group-Protein-Sorting).
