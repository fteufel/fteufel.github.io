I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Copenhagen and Novo Nordisk, advised by [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/). Currently, I'm visiting the [Marks lab](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) at Harvard. My main research interests are deep learning methods for protein sequence analysis, sequence design and property prediction, as well as transfer learning for biological applications in general.   
Previously, I've worked with the [Newman Lab at Stanford](https://anlab.stanford.edu/) on stem cell transcriptomics. 
I studied Biotechnology at ETH ZÃ¼rich, with my thesis research on signal peptide prediction conducted at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Henrik Nielsen](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/research/research-sections/section-bioinformatics/group-protein-sorting).
