I am a Machine Learning Scientist at [Lila Sciences](https://www.lila.ai/).
I obtained my PhD at the University of Copenhagen and Novo Nordisk, advised by [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/), where I worked on ML methods for protein and peptide sequence analysis, sequence design and Bayesian optimization. During my PhD I also spent time in the [Marks lab](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) at Harvard Medical School, working on variant effect prediction.

Previously, I've worked with the [Newman Lab at Stanford](https://anlab.stanford.edu/) on stem cell transcriptomics. 
I studied Biotechnology at ETH ZÃ¼rich, with my thesis research on signal peptide prediction conducted at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Henrik Nielsen](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/research/research-sections/section-bioinformatics/group-protein-sorting).
