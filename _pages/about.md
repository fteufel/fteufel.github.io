I am a machine learning researcher with a background in Biotechnology, working with [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/) at the University of Copenhagen. Additionally, I  spend some of my time with the [Newman Lab at Stanford](https://anlab.stanford.edu/), researching stem cell transcriptomics. My main research interests are deep learning methods for protein sequence analysis and property prediction, as well as transfer learning for biological applications in general. I got my MSc in Biotechnology at ETH ZÃ¼rich, with my thesis research on signal peptide prediction conducted at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Henrik Nielsen](https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/english/Research/Research-Sections/Section-Bioinformatics/Group-Protein-Sorting).
